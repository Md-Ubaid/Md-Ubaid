- 👋 Hi, I’m @Md-Ubaid
deeply passionate about data science, machine learning, and computer science. My journey in technology is fueled by a profound fascination with artificial intelligence and its potential to revolutionize industries and society.

As an aspiring data scientist, I'm constantly refining my skills in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and solving complex computational problems. Through both academic pursuits and personal projects, I've gained hands-on experience with various tools and technologies, enabling me to derive meaningful insights from data.

Beyond my technical interests, I find great joy in playing volleyball and chess. These activities not only provide a welcome balance to my tech endeavors but also sharpen my strategic thinking and teamwork skills, essential in both sports and professional settings.

One of my guiding principles, inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's words in "Wings of Fire," is that "Dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep." This mindset drives my commitment to achieving excellence in the field of computer science and technology.

I'm passionate about learning, growing, and contributing to innovative projects. I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals who share my enthusiasm for AI and data science, and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills and drive to make a meaningful impact.
